How to run 
Run GAMA 1.7 and open the script called FinalProject.gaml which is in the finalProject binder, inside the models binder. Open the file to be checked and press main (left top of script window) to run the simulation. Note that changing the parameter num, changes the number of two agents the Supporters and the Journalists without any repercussions.

The script called FinalProject_Creative.gaml, contains the creative part of the project.

There is another binder called includes, where all the images from the scenery can be found.
